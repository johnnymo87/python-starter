# Python Starter Kit
This app is a starter kit for writing code and [tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) in python. Use it as a seed for starting a new python project. Use the following command to copy this app's code to a new directory:
```console
mkdir -p path/to/new
cp -r path/to/this/directory path/to/new/directory
```

## Dependencies
The only local dependency you need to configure to use this codebase is `docker-compose`. This is great, because once you have docker working, it eliminates the "well it works on my machine" kind of problems. If it works on docker for you, it will work in docker for anyone.

## Install
* Build the image:
  ```console
  docker-compose build
  ```

## Run
* Open a long-running session inside the container:
  ```console
  docker-compose run --rm app bash
  ```
  From here, you can ...
  * Run the tests.
    ```console
    poetry run pytest
    ```
  * Run the `python_starter` module.
    ```console
    poetry run python -m python_starter
    ```
  * Run the auto formatter.
    ```console
    poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
    ```
    * For more usage instructions, see [the pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Debug
* Documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).
* Set a breakpoint with `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`.
  * If you're using vim with [a project-specific .vimrc](https://andrew.stwrt.ca/posts/project-specific-vimrc/), you can type this with `<leader>db`.
* Show where you are with `list`.
* Continue with `continue`.
* Quit with `quit`.

## Add a new python package
This app makes use of [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage packages. See docs there for how to add packages.
